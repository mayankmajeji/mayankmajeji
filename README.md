# 👋 Hi, I’m Mayank Majeji

<!--
**MayankMajeji/mayankmajeji** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a **Full Stack WordPress Developer**, **Product Builder**, and **Technical Architect** with 10+ years of experience creating high-performance, scalable digital products for businesses, agencies, and startups across the globe.

Currently, I lead WordPress architecture and development as **Lead WordPress Developer at [Knight Agency](https://knightagency.com/)** — designing and maintaining front-end and back-end solutions including **multisite networks**, **WooCommerce eCommerce platforms**, **LearnDash LMS systems**, **WordPress SaaS solutions**, and **custom plugins**, all optimized for **performance**, **security**, **accessibility (WCAG 2.1)**, and **technical SEO**.

I'm also the **founder and developer of [UnmaskWP](https://unmaskwp.com)** — a WordPress detection and **ecosystem mapping tool** that analyzes themes, plugins, server configurations, DNS records, SEO metadata, and linked social profiles, helping digital professionals with **competitive research** and **technical audits**.

As a **Core Contributor to the WordPress.org open-source project**, I dedicate time weekly to the **Core, Meta, and Polyglots teams**, and maintain several plugins on WordPress.org and GitHub:

- 🔒 [Smart CAPTCHA Alternative with Cloudflare Turnstile](https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-captcha-alternative-with-cloudflare-turnstile/)
- 🛠️ [MenuPilot – Preview-First Menu Import & Export](https://wordpress.org/plugins/menupilot/)
- 🔍 [Enhanced Admin User Search](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enhanced-admin-user-search/)  
- 🔎 [WP Full Screen Search](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-full-screen-search/)  
- ⚙️ [WP Utility and Performance](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-utility-and-performance/)

Before transitioning full-time into product development and technical leadership, I taught engineering students **C and C++** — which laid the foundation for my structured, extensible approach to software design.

📚 Outside of work, I enjoy reading, writing clean code, watching anime, and exploring new tech and frameworks.
