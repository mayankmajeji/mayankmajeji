# 👋 Hi, I’m Mayank Majeji

<!--

I'm a **Full Stack WordPress Developer** with 10+ years of experience in building high-performance websites, custom plugins, themes, and tools for businesses and agencies across the globe.

Currently, I work as the **Lead WordPress Developer at Knight Agency**, where I architect and maintain front-end and back-end solutions, including multisite networks, eCommerce platforms (WooCommerce), LMS systems (LearnDash), and custom plugins—optimized for performance, security, accessibility, and SEO.

I'm also the **founder and developer of [UnmaskWP](https://unmaskwp.com)**, a comprehensive WordPress detection tool that analyzes themes, plugins, DNS records, server details, and SEO data for any website.

As a **core contributor to the WordPress.org open-source project**, I dedicate time weekly to the **Core, Meta, and Polyglots teams**, and maintain several plugins on both WordPress.org and GitHub:

- 🔍 [Enhanced Admin User Search](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enhanced-admin-user-search/)  
- 🔎 [WP Full Screen Search](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-full-screen-search/)  
- ⚙️ [WP Utility and Performance](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-utility-and-performance/)

Before transitioning full-time into development, I taught engineering students C and C++—which laid the foundation for my structured approach to software.

📚 Outside of work, you’ll usually find me reading, writing clean code, watching anime, or exploring new tech.
